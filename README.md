Computational optimization of the FFT algorithm for cost-effective Mobile Internet

64-bit FFT algorithm is implemented in Xilinx software accounting
for fewer gate counts, lower power consumption and higher speed for
wireless communications, improving the eciency of Mobile internet
download speed by 4 percent.

This project is a module of PhD thesis, hence is confidential and awaiting for permission to be made public
